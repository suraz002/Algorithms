# Divide and Conquer Algorithms
Divide and Conquer algorithmic paradigm which solves the problem. This alogrithm  break the problem into smaller sub problems.
After dividing the problem into smaller program and all the small programs are solved by using recursive method which is called # conquer.
The recursively the program is further divided until and unless the trivial solution is yield. It is also called convergence to solution with #stop condition
